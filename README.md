Christmas is coming, and “Santa Claus Christmas delivery service”, aka Santa4You,  is modernizing. 
You can now track Santa Claus's location and when he will deliver your presents under the Christmas Tree.

The following functional requirements are there:

You can enter your address and state your wish list of 3 items.
You can later edit these 3 items (also after rebooting the application).
Changes are made with a two-factor token by mail. (You can simulate the mail sending and get the code from the log)
You declare what you leave for Santa in return, either milk or cookies, as a return gift as by tradition.
The address has some validation checks.
You can track where Santa is(simulate and have some fun).
